# [](#header-1)Lesson 2

We now turn our attention toward the most general description of the methods
for polymers synthesis or *polymerization*.

We analyze how their molecular structure makes them behave different than
smaller molecules.

Finally, we also explore some of their most relevant physical properties.

**ERRATA (Third video):**

 1. At 1:45, it is said "número de unidades de repetición que contiene esa
    cadena" (number of repetition units in each chain), but it should be
    "número de cadenas con esa masa" (number of chains with that mass).

 2. At 12:10 should say "microscopía de luz polarizada" (polarized-light
    microscopy) instead of "microscopía bifocal."

 3. At 21:26, it is mentioned that the crystallization temperature is higher
    than the melting temperature. This is no true. $ T_c $ is always less than
    or equal to $ T_m $.
