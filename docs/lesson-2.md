# [](#header-1)Lesson 2

We now turn our attention toward the most general description of the methods
for polymers synthesis or *polymerization*.

We analyze how their molecular structure makes them behave different than
smaller molecules.

Finally, we also explore some of their most relevant physical properties.

**ERRATA (Thirs video):**

 1. At 21:26, it is mentioned that the crystallization temperature is higher
    than the melting temperature. This is no true. $T_c$ is always less than or
    equal to $T_m$.

 2. At 12:10 should say "microscopía de luz polarizada" (polarized-light
    microscopy) instead of "microscopía bifocal."
