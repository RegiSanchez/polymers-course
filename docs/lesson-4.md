**ERRATA (Lesson 4):**

 1. At 2:36, "5 mil millones de piezas de plástico" should be "5 billones de
    piezas de plástico" instead.

 2. At 10:46, it should say "1.8 billones de piezas de plástico" as opossed to
    "1.8 millones de piezas de plástico."

 3. At 25:33, I referred to "la empresa" when I was meaning to say "la
    organización sin fines de lucro."
